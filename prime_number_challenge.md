# Prime Number Challenge

Please create a simple app with a graphical user interface that allows
the user to enter a number, and then press a button to learn if that
number is prime. The app's main activity should have the following:

-   A field for the user to enter a number.

-   A button for the user to press.

-   An output field that displays whether or not the entered number is a
    prime number.

-   The app should not crash if the user enters something other than a
    number. It should behave gracefully, perhaps by preventing the user
    from entering non-numeric characters, or showing an error message if
    it couldn't understand the input.

So for example, if the user enters a 2, 3, 5, or 7, the app should
display "Yes" or "True" or something similar. If the user enters a 4, 9,
or 15, the app should display "No" or "False" or something similar.
